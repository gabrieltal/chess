## Overview

A fully functional chess game made with React and JavaScript. Currently you can only play against yourself.
I built it using the React docs [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial as a baseline
just to get started, but took it from the initial setup to make a chess game.

Initialized this project using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Background

I've been playing chess on [chess.com](https://chess.com) for a while now. I'm not very good, but feel free to [challenge me](https://www.chess.com/member/plant_person) :). I made this in November 2020 after getting laid off. I wanted to brush up on my React and I had chess fresh on my mind after watching Queen's Gambit.

I grew a greater appreciation of the rule of chess while making this. It is a complex game, en passant, castling and the check/checkmate logic were the toughest to crack.


## Installation

### Requirements

- [React](https://reactjs.org)

### Setup

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/gabrieltal/chess.git
 cd chess
 yarn install
```

To run the application in development mode:

  yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Tests

```bash
yarn test
```

### Deployment

```bash
yarn deploy
```

## TODOs

* I want to add functionality to look back at each move by clicking on the move history so you can cycle through the entire game you played and look over your moves.

* Add more tests, only have basic model movement tests set up.
